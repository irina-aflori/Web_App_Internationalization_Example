# Web_App_Internationalization_Example
## Purpose
The proposed code represents a React project that demonstrates how internationalization is used for rendering a page with information about several species of flowers.
## Description
This example allows users to access a page in one of the six available languages: English, Romanian, French, German, Spanish, and Arabic. In this way, it illustrates a basic demonstration of internationalization to reach a global audience, offering users the option to view content in a language familiar to them.
## Imported packages
* npm install react-i18next i18next --save
* npm i i18next-xhr-backend
* npm i react-flags-select
* npm i @material-ui/core
## Code Overview
* create React project
* install dependencies (using react-i18next framework - the core that provides all translation functionality)
* configure a specific file i18n.js for internationalization process
* choose what content you want to render in App.js file
* translate the content using a specific JSON file for every language and place them in "locale" folder, located in "public" folder
* use interpolation because it allows the integration of dynamic values into translations
* run the React application on localhost:3000
## Usage
To use this code, meet the following conditions:
* download the React project from this Github repository
* run the project by executing the "npm start" command in the terminal
* access the application through a web browser
* navigate through the page by choosing one of the six available languages using the button located on the left
